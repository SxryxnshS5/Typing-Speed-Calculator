# Typing Speed Calculator

**Author:** Suryansh Singh

This Java program calculates the typing speed of a user based on their input. It prompts the user to type a given text, measures the time taken to complete the typing, and calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

## How It Works

1. The program displays a predefined text for the user to type.
2. The user is instructed to press Enter when they are ready to start.
3. Upon pressing Enter, the program records the start time of typing.
4. The user types the provided text, and the typed text is recorded.
5. After completion, the end time is recorded, and the elapsed time is calculated.
6. The typed text is split into words, and the number of words typed is determined.
7. The typing speed is calculated by dividing the number of words by the elapsed time in minutes.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program using a Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the instructions to type the provided text.
4. The program will display the time taken, the number of words typed, and the typing speed in WPM.

## Sample Output

Time taken: 14236 milliseconds
Words Typed: 17
Typing Speed: 71.64933970216353 words per minute


## Note

This program provides a basic implementation of typing speed calculation and doesn't account for factors like errors, formatting, or special characters. It can be extended for more robust features.
